  * To drain companies like UG.com of capital until it it forced to stop capitalizing on a corpus of materials that were generated by unpaid contrubutors predating their existance.
  * To give perfectly legal and non-copywrite infringing tools to schools, churches, solo educators, community arts groups, and most importantly the self taught, that allow them to grow was musicians as wall as facilitate contributing back to the musical arts community as a whole.
* History:
  * OLGA
  * Harry Fucks(Fox) debacle
  * The abombination called "Ultimate" Guitar
    * It's pretty much "Needful Things" from R&M
    * This is an attempt to be it's "Curse Purge Plus"
    * UG takes something that was originally a noble and non commercial community effort to help facilliate music education for people who don't have Lana Del Ray's parents, and turned it into a shameless ads grab from a large group of people that have little to nothing.
